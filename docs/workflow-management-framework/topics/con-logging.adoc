= Logging Module

The RainCatcher Logger Module is a logging facade for node.js based applications and it is used by all RainCatcher modules. The RainCatcher Logger Module is is contained in the `raincatcher-core` module.

There are two loggers contained within the RainCatcher Logger Module, the Bunyan module and the Console module.
By default, Bunyan module and the Console module are not setup and so, no logging exists by default.
Users can use their own loggers by wrapping their logger into the provided class.
